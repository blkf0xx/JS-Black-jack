# BLACK JACK JS

## A Black Jack game written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

### GAME PLAY
Click the 'Hit' or 'Stay' buttons to draw cards and get as close as possible to 21 without going over (bust) to beat the dealer. 

### REQUIREMENTS:

- [ ] Include win/loss logic and render win/loss messages in HTML. Popup alerts using the alert() method are okay during development, but not production.
